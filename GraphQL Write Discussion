GraphQL Write Discussion

1. Should we merge incompatible columns in mergeRows?
  - need to tackle when we handle AN upload
  - need to understand effort to change the current "AN wins" behavior


2. List[rows] - does it have schema data or not?
  - tricky but possible to do in QuerySevice + Schema Manager
  - keep same semantic for merge table insert rows and update rows
  - reconcilation rules?

3. Is it ok for most operations (except create/delete table) to deal with sets of data and not individual items?
  - mainly for column operations
  - possible to make all mutation function to operate on a data set instead of an individual data

4. How do we handle partial success for bulk operations? (raise error or finish what you can?)
  - for functions that process a set of data, it's preferrable to be atomic, and thus no partial success. This is the default behavior.

  mutation {
    doFirstThing(argument)
    doSecondThing(argument)

    deleteTable(ids: [1,3])
  }

5. Do update APIs for large rows follow same pagination constraints as read APIs?

6. MergeTables - merge two existing tables, or merge a set of rows/schema into an existing table?

7. record_id - Will QS generate it for new uploads? Is it guaranteed to be globally unique? How is it returned?

8. Table name in Schema Manager

1. identify a set of async use cases and operations
